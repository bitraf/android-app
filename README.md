Bitraf is a indie makerspace in Oslo , funded and loved by members. This app allows you to open the door to bitraf if you have the correct credentials. You can also turn on geofencing which will give you a notification that you can use to open the door if you are near Bitraf. This geofence option is nice when paired with an Android Wear. You can open the door without touching your phone.
If you like to hack on this app, reach out to a member at bitraf and you'll be pointed in the right direction. (Hint, you are very close)
